@W: MT529 :"c:\lscc\lattice_projects\xsdr_fpga_lora_tx\impl1\source\clockdivider.v":31:0:31:5|Found inferred clock my_pll_64mhz|CLKOP_inferred_clock which controls 33 sequential elements including clockDivider_0.counter[7:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
